# SQL_GUI_Example
This is a simply GUI for a program that stores book information in a SQL database.
The basic functions (INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE) have been implemented.

The user runs BookStore.py from a command line. My current environment does not allow me to use pyinstaller to create an .exe, but that's on the to-do.
